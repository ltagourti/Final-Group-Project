    "Understanding the factors that influence player engagement is crucial in the gaming industry, as it informs game design, marketing strategies, and resource allocation. In this study, we explore the predictive relationship between a player's age and experience on the total time they spend playing on a Minecraft server. Specifically, we use k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression to estimate the number of hours a player dedicates to the game based on these demographic factors."

The dataset includes a diverse player base, providing a detailed view of engagement patterns across different age groups and experience levels. Prior to analysis, the data underwent wrangling; cleaning and preprocessing to ensure accuracy and consistency, including handling missing values and standardizing data formats.
